<h1>TAMID Tech Coding Assignment</h1>
This is the TAMID Tech Coding Assignment for Benjamin Blinder.

To create this page, I used the NodeJS and BootStrap frameworks as well as some standard CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

The page should run without any extra steps or issues, but in the case that it does not work, running the "npm install" command in the terminal should fix any issues.

If you have any issues, concerns, or questions I can be contacted at Btblinder1@gmail.com
