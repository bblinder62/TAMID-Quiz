<h1>TAMID Tech Coding Assignment</h1>
This is the TAMID Tech Coding Assignment for Benjamin Blinder.

To create this page, I used the NodeJS and BootStrap frameworks as well as some standard CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. I used frameworks instead of just creating a standard single file because this way it would be faster and easier to create a full website around the page already created.

<h1>Running the Wep Page</h1>
The page should run without any issues by using the terminal, navigating to this folder, and running the "node" command, but in the case that it does not work, running the "npm install" command in the terminal should fix any issues.

If you have any issues, concerns, or questions I can be contacted at Btblinder1@gmail.com
